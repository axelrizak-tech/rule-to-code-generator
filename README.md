Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based automation that converts business rules defined in a CSV file into executable Python decision logic.
Instead of manually coding decision rules, users can define them in a simple, human-readable format and automatically generate production-ready logic.

Problem

In many organizations, business rules are:
defined in Excel or documents,
manually translated into code,
difficult to maintain and audit.
This leads to:
slow changes,
errors during implementation,
dependency on developers for simple rule updates.

Solution

The Rule-to-Code Generator:
reads business rules from a CSV file,
validates rule structure,
generates a clean Python decision function,
outputs ready-to-use automation logic.
